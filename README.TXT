** Installation Notes **
************************
If you are downloading the installer, just use it. Pretty standard stuff.

If you are downloading from Github, you need to build the thing.
I used Visual Studio 2008, on a machine with SQL Server 2008 installed.
I think those two programs are required for the build to be succesfull.

The project you're probably interested the most is SlxUniAx, which is the
WinForms app.
The side library SlxUniLib contains the code that's actually doing all the
work. If you watch inside and find some bug, drop me a line or a pull request
on Github.

** Usage Instructions **
************************
To be done... (shame on me)
Tha application should be pretty self-explanatory. If it's not, you probably should not be
using the software in the first place ;)
